### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

P0: The probability of people who are on a diet not losing more fat than those who do not. 
P1: The probability of people who are on a diet losing more fat than those who do not.
H0: P1 >= P0.  

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

P0: The probability of children (at age 1, 2, 3, 4) with moms who smoked during pregnancy not having lower IQ compared to their peers whos moms did not smoke during pregnancy. 
P1: The probability of children (at age 1, 2, 3, 4) with moms who smoked during pregnancy having lower IQ compared to their peers whos moms did not smoke during pregnancy.
H0: P1 >= P0. 
**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, 
usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets,
and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
P0:
