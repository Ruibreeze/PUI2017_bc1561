1. For part one, I made comments about the null hypothesis made by Dana. For specifics, please refer to the md file in her repository.

2. For part two, I collaborated with Gerado (grv232). please refer to the above table for more details.

3. For part three, I follow the instructions of the notebook, and replicated the study. please refer to the notebook for more details

4. For part four, I did ks test, pearson's test and spearson's test for the requested datasets. For the evalChisq function, I found the function on the internet, please refer to the link in comments in the cell I recorded the function. When generating the manhattan and brooklyn location dummy, I talked to Professor Bianco, and decided to use boxes as a generic boundary to classify location. when running the tests, I was also inspired Professor Bianco's method to bin up the data so that the two data sets can appear sorted and of the same length.
