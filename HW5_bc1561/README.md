### HW5 read me

#### Part 1
I generated a distribution of z statistics and proved that it does indeed follows the normal distribution

#### Part 2
I tested Binomial and Poisson distribution against normal distribution using KS/AD/Chisq/KL test.

for hypothesis rejecting/accepting, I collaborated with Gerado and Marium. However, I am still extremely confused about stuff

#### Part 3
I got stuck on importing data, but I was inspired by Unisse to push the data onto my repository.
for the weighted regression, I got help from Rachel about how to create the weights.
