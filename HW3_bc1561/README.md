# PUI2017 HW 3 README

## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

In Assignment1, I generated 100 distributions of random size from 10 to 2000 with the same population mean (mymean = 100) for five different distributions, including _Normal_, _Poisson_, _Binomial_, _Chi-Squared_, _Logistic_ distributions.
For each graph I generated a scatter plot and a histogram with sample mean as y against sample size as x.

then for the __extra credit__, I fitted a gaussian curve to the distribution of means (in this part I looked up on google for guidence, and decided to use `from scipy.stats import norm
` to draw the curve)

### Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. You should, even more than usual, work in groups for this!

In this part I used a jupyter notebook to process citibike sharing data. for specific null hypothesis forming and plots, please refer to the citibike.ipynb file

## Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook .

In this part I followed and referred to the instructions on the class slides and implemented the z statistics. for specific null hypothesis testing please refere to Assignment3.ipynb file.
